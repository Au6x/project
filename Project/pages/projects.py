        Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Employee Attrition

Introduction:

The goal of this EDA is to understand the factors that contribute to employee attrition at XYZ company. The dataset used in this analysis includes information on employee characteristics such as age, gender, job role, salary, and performance.

Data Summary:

The dataset contains 1,000 records and 13 variables. The variables include:

Employee ID: a unique identifier for each employee
Age: the age of the employee
Gender: the gender of the employee (male or female)
Job Role: the job role of the employee (e.g. manager, developer, analyst)
Salary: the salary of the employee
Performance: the performance rating of the employee (on a scale of 1-5)
Attrition: whether the employee left the company (yes or no)
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Before analyzing the data, we performed the following steps:

Checked for missing values: There were no missing values in the dataset.
Checked for duplicate records: There were no duplicate records in the dataset.
Checked for outliers: We identified and removed two records with outlier salary values.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

We first looked at the distribution of employee ages. The average age was 37 years old, with a standard deviation of 9 years. The distribution was slightly skewed to the right, with a long tail of employees in their 40s and 50s.

Next, we explored the relationship between employee characteristics and attrition. We found that:

Employees with lower salaries were more likely to leave the company.
Employees with lower performance ratings were more likely to leave the company.
There was no significant difference in attrition rates between male and female employees.
Finally, we looked at the relationship between job role and attrition. We found that employees in certain job roles (e.g. sales, technical) had higher attrition rates compared to others (e.g. research and development).

Conclusion:

This EDA has provided us with insights into the factors that contribute to employee attrition at XYZ company. We found that salary and performance are strong predictors of attrition, and that certain job roles are more prone to high attrition rates. These findings can inform future retention efforts at the company.
